# Debounce Sample

This is a simple Flutter sample project that demonstrates the **debouncing concept** in a real-world UI scenario.
The app contains a searchable list where the filtering logic is triggered **only after the user stops typing**, instead of reacting to every keystroke.
This approach helps improve performance and provides a smoother user experience, especially with large datasets.
